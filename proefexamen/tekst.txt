Why?
WE ARE addING another cause?
A study in 2022 found that more women and children were becoming homeless in Belgium. They documented 3,847 homeless people. 1/3 of people found to be homeless were women, while a quarter were children.
Every day members of the Antwerp social services team head out onto the streets to look for people who are obliged to sleep out on the streets at night. “We do a round every morning and evening. We’ve got food and drink with us. We listen to people’s stories and tell them where they can head. We make an extra effort when it freezes. The stations, parks and enclosed car parks are popular among rough sleepers. People who notice homeless people sleeping rough can always let us know” says Huygen.

Where to go when in trouble
Each year the Antwerp-based companies make almost 50 apartments available to homeless people and they are supported by Antwerp’s “CAWs”.
Alongside this form of rehousing, there is a serious need to create other available options, especially by bringing together housing and individual support (based on the Housing First model).
As part of Housing First Belgium, the project partners in Antwerp are experimenting with a new system of using empty apartments that are in need of some minor renovations in which to house temporarily people suffering from chronic homelessness. Long-term solutions have to be found during this period.
